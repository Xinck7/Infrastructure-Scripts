# Infrastructure-Scripts
<br>
For Deploying and Managing Environments:
<br>
This will be the repository that handles large production setting scripts.
<br>
Primarily for learning and using devops tools. 
<br>
There may be scripts used for this purpose in the linux or powershell scripts repo's I have as well. 
<br>
They will stay there instead of be duplicated unless the specific environment uses that script and needs it in this repo.
